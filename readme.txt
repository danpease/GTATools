This is just a small guide on using this tool.

Very simply, it automates a couple of tedious tasks. All commands are found in the windows context menu under GTA Tools.

Each option does as follows:


YFT, YDR and YTD files have an option to "_hi it". For yft and ydr files, this creates a copy of the existing yft file and renames it to it's _hi variant.
Right clicking on a .yft or .ydr file will show options to "_hi it". Choosing this will create a simple _hi version of your file.


You will also notice an option to make a new YTD file. When clicking on a file, this will create a YTD of the same name. However, when clicking in a folder itself, it will generate a blank YTD file named new.ytd.

I have also included an option to create a new Z3D file in both file and folder context menus.
